**Overview of the project**

**Project: STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION by using Stocks dataset**


**Objectives**: Analyze historical stock market data to uncover patterns and trends and predict future stock prices using a combination of time series analysis and deep learning models like LSTM.

1. **Understand Stock Price Trends**: Perform exploratory analysis to visualize and understand historical stock price movements.  
2. **Stationarity Check**: Evaluate the time series for stationarity to decide on the preprocessing steps required for time series modeling.  
3. **Deep Learning Prediction**: Implement an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict future stock prices using historical data.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's predictive accuracy using visualizations and performance metrics.  


**Key Activities**:  

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Load the dataset and clean duplicate rows.  
   - Parse and set the date column as the index.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualize stock price trends over time.  
   - Perform stationarity checks using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.  

3. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Normalize the stock prices using Min-Max scaling.  
   - Create input sequences for LSTM modeling.  

4. **Model Development**:  
   - Build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for time series forecasting.  
   - Train the model on 80% of the dataset and validate using the remaining 20%.  

5. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Compare the actual and predicted stock prices using visualizations.  
   - Analyze the model's performance using visual error analysis.  


**Technologies Used**:  
- **Python Libraries**:
  - **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For EDA and visualizations.
  - **Statsmodels**: For stationarity tests using the ADF test.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For normalization and preprocessing.
  - **Keras/TensorFlow**: For building and training the LSTM model.


**Key Findings** (Expected):  
1. Historical stock price trends provide insights into market behaviors and anomalies.  
2. Time series data often exhibit non-stationarity, requiring transformations for effective modeling.  
3. LSTM models can effectively capture sequential dependencies, providing accurate forecasts of stock prices.  


**Potential Insights**:  
- Use stock price predictions for decision-making in trading strategies.  
- Identify the impact of past trends on future prices.  
- Highlight areas where the model needs improvement for long-term predictions.
